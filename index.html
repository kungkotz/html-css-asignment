              <h2 class=""><b>Open source</b></h2>
              <p >
                Ubuntu has always been free to download, use and share. We
                believe in the power of open source software; Ubuntu could not
                exist without its worldwide community of voluntary developers.
              </p>
              
              <h2><b>Secure</b></h2>
              <p>
                With a built-in firewall and virus protection software, Ubuntu
                is one of the most secure operating systems around. And the
                long-term support releases give you five years of security
                patches and updates.
              </p>
              
              <h2><b>Accessible</b></h2>
              <p>
                Computing is for everyone regardless of nationality, gender or
                disability. Ubuntu is fully translated into over 50 languages
                and includes essential assistive technologies.
              </p>
              
              <h2><b>Available on the largest range of hardware, ever</b></h2>
              <p>
                Canonical works closely with Dell, Lenovo and HP to certify
                that Ubuntu works on a wide range of their laptops and
                workstations. It means that a seamless Ubuntu experience is
                available out of the box with more hardware choice than ever.
              
                And Ubuntu isn’t just for the desktop, it is used in data
                centres around the world powering every kind of server
                imaginable and is by far, the most popular operating system in
                the cloud.

                <p>
                  Pop!_OS uses auto-tiling for the same reason that people hire
                  assistants: Organizing your work is incredibly time-consuming.
                  Sure, you could still move, resize, and arrange windows
                  yourself, but why spend the time when your OS does it for you?
                  Auto-tiling helps you be both organized and efficient, and is
                  especially convenient on large displays.
                </p>

                  another desktop. Problem solved.

              <p>
                Most things Linux are open source. This means the source code
                for these things can be modified and used very freely to build
                other things. Like the Android operating system or the version
                of BSD running on the Playstation 5. It's a team effort where
                everyone can contribute..
