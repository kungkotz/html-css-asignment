              <br>
              Representing a perfect middle-ground for those who want good performance, full control, and cutting-edge software but also a degree of software stability.

            <h2 class=""><b>Open source</b></h2>
            <p class="">
              Ubuntu has always been free to download, use and share. We
              believe in the power of open source software; Ubuntu could not
              exist without its worldwide community of voluntary developers.
            </p>
            
            <h2><b>Secure</b></h2>
            <p>
              With a built-in firewall and virus protection software, Ubuntu
              is one of the most secure operating systems around. And the
              long-term support releases give you five years of security
              patches and updates.
            </p>
            
            <h2><b>Accessible</b></h2>
            <p>
              Computing is for everyone regardless of nationality, gender or
              disability. Ubuntu is fully translated into over 50 languages
              and includes essential assistive technologies.
            </p>
            
            <h2><b>Available on the largest range of hardware, ever</b></h2>
            <p>
              Canonical works closely with Dell, Lenovo and HP to certify
              that Ubuntu works on a wide range of their laptops and
              workstations. It means that a seamless Ubuntu experience is
              available out of the box with more hardware choice than ever.
            
              And Ubuntu isn’t just for the desktop, it is used in data
              centres around the world powering every kind of server
              imaginable and is by far, the most popular operating system in
              the cloud.

            <p>
              Pop!_OS is an operating system for STEM and creative
              professionals who use their computer as a tool to discover and
              create. Unleash your potential on secure, reliable open source
              software. Based on your exceptional curiosity, we sense you
              have a lot of it.
            </p>
            <h2><b>Auto-Tiling With Pop Shell</b></h2>
            <p>
              Pop!_OS uses auto-tiling for the same reason that people hire
              assistants: Organizing your work is incredibly time-consuming.
              Sure, you could still move, resize, and arrange windows
              yourself, but why spend the time when your OS does it for you?
              Auto-tiling helps you be both organized and efficient, and is
              especially convenient on large displays.
            </p>
            
            <h2><b>Workspaces</b></h2>
            <p>
              Keep relevant content together and irrelevant content out of
              sight. When the clutter overwhelms you, just toss it onto
              another desktop. Problem solved.
            </p>
            
            <h2><b>Keyboard Navigation</b>
            </h2>
            
                <p>
                  Arm yourself with a dark-lord level of power at your
                  fingertips. Use keyboard shortcuts to:
                </p>
              <div class=" row"><li>Move/resize windows</li>
                <li>Search for anything</li>
                <li>Launch applications</li></div>
                
            
              <h2><b>Stacking</b></h2>
              <p>
              Stack application windows atop one another like tabs in a web
              browser. Just remember to switch off of Steam when the boss
              walks in.

              <p>
                Most things Linux are open source. This means the source code
                for these things can be modified and used very freely to build
                other things. Like the Android operating system or the version
                of BSD running on the Playstation 5. It's a team effort where
                everyone can contribute..
